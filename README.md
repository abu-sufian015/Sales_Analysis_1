## ðŸ“Š Excel Practice Problems & Solutions
## ðŸ”¹ Basic Level  

1. **Find the total sales**  
ðŸ‘‰ `=SUM(E2:E21)`  
âœ” Returns the total of the Sales column.  

2. **Find the average profit**  
ðŸ‘‰ `=AVERAGE(H2:H21)`  
âœ” Returns the average of the Profit column.  

3. **Find the highest sales value**  
ðŸ‘‰ `=MAX(E2:E21)`  

4. **Count how many orders were from the "West" region**  
ðŸ‘‰ `=COUNTIF(D2:D21,"West")`  

5. **Count how many orders were for "Laptop"**  
ðŸ‘‰ `=COUNTIF(B2:B21,"Laptop")`

## ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Level  

6. **Calculate total sales after discount for each order**  
ðŸ‘‰ New column formula: `=E2-(E2*G2/100)`  

7. **Find average sales by region**  
ðŸ‘‰ PivotTable â†’ Rows: Region, Values: Average of Sales  

8. **Find which product generated the highest profit**  
ðŸ‘‰ PivotTable â†’ Rows: Product, Values: Sum of Profit â†’ Sort descending  

9. **Calculate total profit margin % for all orders**  
ðŸ‘‰ `=SUM(H2:H21)/SUM(E2:E21)`

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced Level  

10. **Calculate Profit Margin % for each order**  
ðŸ‘‰ New column formula: `=H2/E2`  

11. **Find month-wise total sales trend**  
ðŸ‘‰ Use: `=TEXT(I2,"MMM-YYYY")` â†’ PivotTable by Month â†’ Sum of Sales  

12. **Find top 3 highest sales orders**  
ðŸ‘‰ `=LARGE(E2:E21,{1,2,3})`  

13. **Identify which month had the highest sales**  
ðŸ‘‰ Add column `=TEXT(I2,"MMM-YYYY")` â†’ PivotTable by Month â†’ Max Sales  

14. **Calculate total sales per region per month**  
ðŸ‘‰ PivotTable â†’ Rows: Region, Columns: Month, Values: Sum of Sales

18. **Which product is most sensitive to discount (discount â†‘ â†’ profit â†“)?**  
ðŸ‘‰ Scatter chart: Discount vs Profit â†’ Look for steep negative trend  

19. **Calculate Year-to-Date (YTD) sales**  
ðŸ‘‰ `=SUMIFS(E:E,I:I,"<="&TODAY())`

ðŸ‘‰ `=IF(E2>AVERAGE($E$2:$E$21),"Above Avg","Below Avg")`  

21. **Rank products based on sales**  
ðŸ‘‰ `=RANK(E2,$E$2:$E$21,0)`
